## The story

I stumbled upont this [post](https://x.com/vnglst/status/1751278052154179770) and immediately wanted to create my own version. I was even more interested when I saw the [implementation](https://github.com/vnglst/pong-wars): it was a single HTML file with some vanilla JS in a _script_ tag; the OG way of building. As a long time Typescript user, I developed a habit of dismissing the idea of building something in vanilla JS, but I wanted to see for myself if I could implement my version in the same setup, while preserving most of Typescript's ergonomics via [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/tags-param) comments.
